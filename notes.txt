PAGE

    - Rebuild the container/item system to a grid

    - filters -> price
    - order -> price, amount, name

    - organize section

    - style all page

    - standardize responsive breakpoints, after that, standardize paddings, fonts, gaps, etc



ISSUES

    - When searching on a book page or store page, if the search has an existing item, not necessarily on the store/book page, the not-found section does not appear



FILES
    
    - organize css files



GENERAL IDEAS

    - on book page, add price of each store for the book



IT WORKS NOW, MIGHT REQUIRE UPDATE LATER

    - All types of json search (books, stores, names, id)



FUTURE / COMPLEX IDEAS

    - Price Tracking
