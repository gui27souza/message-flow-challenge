PAGE

    - filters -> price range, units range
    - order -> price, amount, name

    - organize section

    - style all page

    - style no-items-found

    - adjust items templates on create_item.js



ISSUES

    - When searching on a book page or store page, if the search has an existing item, not necessarily on the store/book page, the not-found section does not appear

    - when no items are found, display:none the container



FILES
    



GENERAL IDEAS

    - on book page, add price of each store for the book



IT WORKS NOW, MIGHT REQUIRE UPDATE LATER

    - All types of json search (books, stores, names, id)



FUTURE / COMPLEX IDEAS

    - Price Tracking
